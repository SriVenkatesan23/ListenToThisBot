# ListenToThisBot

##What It Does

The purpose of this bot is to make a Youtube playlist consisting of the 10 most upvoted posts of the week on r/listentothis. This bot ignores any links that aren't from Youtube. 


##What Is r/listentothis?

It is a subreddit where users post links to songs that they would like to recommend, and others can upvote submissions if they like them. Generally, listening to music on this subreddit requires the user to individually click on each link to open it in a new tab, which is inconvenient. Therefore, I decided it would be a lot easier if you could just automatically generate a playlist of the top submissions.


##Progress

As of now, the bot works fine creating a playlist in my Youtube account. I'm working on making it so anyone can use it.
