# ListenToThisBot

##What It Does

The purpose of this bot is to make a Youtube playlist consisting of the most upvoted posts of the week in a subreddit. This bot ignores any links that aren't from Youtube.


##Why did I make this?

Generally, finding music or videos on Reddit requires the user to individually click on each link to open it in a new tab, which is inconvenient. Therefore, I decided it would be a lot easier if you could just automatically generate a playlist of the top submissions in a subreddit.


##Progress

As of now, the bot works fine creating a playlist in my Youtube account. I'm working on making it so anyone can use it.
